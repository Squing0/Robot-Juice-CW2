# ðŸ¤– Robot-Juice-CW2
Website made as part of web design and development module at Edge Hill University. Grade: 92%.

We were given two pages of a website and were tasked of making an actual website that looked as similar as possible to these two pages and that was also fully functionable. The site was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (specifically JQuery) for the poll feature and loading in extra reviews from the API.
